# Team-11

What we aimed with this project was to help Julia's House to keep track of their staff state. Also, we are helping the staff to keep track of their timetable each day.

We do hope that as much as these cats made you "aww", this application will make the carers and nurses to feel the same "aww"
when they see the care Julia's House gives to them.
