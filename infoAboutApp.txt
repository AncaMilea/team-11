The logoIn in the page is based on their ID and password, got after they signed in. This step
is due to security reasons, as we know how much Julia's House values their coustemers sensible

We have only one page due to ease of use and straightforwardness, less time spent on the app.
The Timetable is divided in chunks of bright blue for each day. Go button is for stating they are
leaving the current location. Arrived is for telling they got to the destionation. Finish signals
the fact they finished that sit. Pressing that button the Timetable will update itself, leaving
only the timeslots that will follow.

The Carer will hit the "Go to safe place" when leaving for home or any other place that does not
involve work. A cute message will pop up after hitting that button, to make them mind their trip.

After 2h if they haven't pressed Arrived at safe place a pop up will appear and ask them if they arrived.
